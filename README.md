Macaroons are Better Than Cookies!
==================================

This Javascript library (actually, it's written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/))
provides an implementation of macaroons[[1]](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html),
which are flexible authorization tokens that work great in distributed systems.
Like cookies, macaroons are bearer tokens that enable applications to ascertain whether their
holders' actions are authorized.  But macaroons are better than cookies!

This project started as a port of libmacaroons[[2]](https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons) library.
The primary goals are
   * being compatible to libmacaroons (and others)
   * being the reference implementation in the Javascript community ;-)

There is a [playground](http://www.macaroons.io/) (testing environment) available,
where you can build and verify macaroons online. 

## Work in Progress !!!
